# Presenting Data: Plotting Conditional Means {#plot_means}

The idea when plotting conditional means is to show how the outcome, or variable of interest, varies as a function of predictors.

Today we'll be working with a dataset from IBM which provide a standard HR dataset, which we can use to predict attrition. (*Note that this is simulated data, no employee information is being disclosed*) Attrition in this case is defined as an employee leaving without being fired or retiring. Companies generally attempt to avoid attrition, as it's very expensive to search for and hire a replacement-- better in general to keep the employees you have, provided they are doing their jobs. This means that it's important to predict who might leave in a given year. This information can be used in a targeted way in order to focus resources on the employees most likely to leave.

## Setup for plotting conditional means

We start with a standard set of setup commands. Today we'll be working with `tidyverse`, as usual, along with a library called `forcats` which helps us to deal with the dreaded factor variables. To handle colors, we'll need the package `RColorBrewer.`

```{r  include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

library(tidyverse)
library(RColorBrewer)
library(knitr)
```

Next we load in the data.

## Loading Data 
```{r}
load("attrition.Rdata")
```

Today, our primary outcome of interest will be attrition. This is a binary variable that is currently encoded as text-- "Yes" or "No." We need to encode it as a binary variable with 1 meaning yes and 0 meaning no. After recoding, we need to make sure that the new variable looks correct.

```{r}
## Create a new variable named attrit and define it as 0
at<-at%>%
  mutate(attrit=ifelse(Attrition=="Yes", 1, 
                       ifelse(Attrition=="No", 0, 
                              NA))) 
#it's important to ensure you don't have missing before using the command like this (what would happen if you did have missing on this?)

#LOOK at your variables to be sure you created them properly
table(at$Attrition) #original var

table(at$attrit) #var we created in line 40

table(at$attrit, at$Attrition) #crosstab to be sure nothing got screwed up
```


##Univariate Graphics

Univariate graphics help us understand what individual variables look like-- how are they distributed across the sample? Here's a quick rundown on some univariate graphics. Say we wanted a quick count of who was in each department. We can use geom_bar to get this done. By default, this will give us a count in each department. 

```{r}
deptbar<-ggplot(at, aes(x=Department, fill=Department))
deptbar<-deptbar + geom_bar()
deptbar

#This is the SAME CODE (just slightly different formatting)
deptbar<-ggplot(at, aes(x=Department, fill=Department)) + 
  geom_bar()
deptbar
``` 

The next univariate graphic you should know is for continuous variables. The first thing you generally want is a histogram. 

```{r}
gg<-ggplot(at, aes(x=DistanceFromHome))
gg<-gg+geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, fill="#1c4869")
gg
``` 

Density plots also provide a graphic of the distribution of a continuous variable:
```{r}
gg<-ggplot(at, aes(x=DistanceFromHome))
gg<-gg+geom_density()
gg

## Changing smoothing bandwidth--NOT recommended for this data, just showing you how. 
gg<-gg+geom_density(bw=.5)
gg
```


## Predicting Attrition

Our first prediction will use business travel as a predictor for attrition. There are three categories here: non travel, travel infrequently, and frequent travel. We'll calculate levels of attrition at each level and then take a look at the data. 

```{r}
#create a new dataset that just has the mean of our three groups; THIS is what we want to plot
at_sum<-at%>% 
  group_by(BusinessTravel)%>%
  summarize(attr_avg=mean(attrit))
#Think about what these numbers are? What's the mean/average of binary (0, 1) data? 

at_sum
```

Remember that the mean of a binary variable indicates the proportion of the population that has a certain characteristics. So, in our case, `r  round(at_sum$attr_avg[2],2)` of the sample that travels frequently left the company in the last year. Our first plot will be a basic bar plot, showing the average levels of attrition. 

To get started, let's see what this looks like in a table.
```{r}
at%>%
  count(BusinessTravel, attrit)%>%
  group_by(BusinessTravel)%>%
  mutate(prop = prop.table(n)*100)%>% ##you can add a *100 here to convert these to percentages
  select(-n)%>%
  spread(attrit, prop)%>% #pretties the table up by adding 0/1 columns
  kable() #also pretties the table up - formatting-wise
```

Now we can plot it:

```{r}
#Bar Plot with aesthetics: mean attrition as height, business travel as category
gg<-ggplot(at_sum, aes(x=BusinessTravel, y=attr_avg))
#Use bar plot geometry, height of bars set by level observed in dataset
gg<-gg+geom_bar(stat="Identity", fill="gold", color="black")
#Print
gg
```

This is fine, but it should really be in the order of the underlying variable. We can use `fct_reorder` to do this. 

_Side_ _Note_

What is a factor variable? In R, factor variables are used for categorical data. These are data elements that can take on one and only one value of a mutually exclusive and exhaustive list of elements. In our case, the travel variable is a factor-- employees can be in Non-Travel, Travel Frequently or Travel Rarely bins. Everyone is one bin, and the bins cover all possible options. We use factors when numbers won't work-- for characteristics like race or religion or political affiliation. 

```{r}
## Same aesthetics, but now ordered by level
gg<-ggplot(at_sum, aes(x=fct_reorder(BusinessTravel, attr_avg), y=attr_avg)) #reordered by level of attrition (lowest to highest, left to right)
gg<-gg+geom_bar(stat="identity", fill="gold", color="black")
gg

## Labeling and colors
gg<-gg+xlab("Amount of Travel")+ylab("Yearly Attrition")
gg<-gg+geom_bar(stat="Identity", fill="gold", color="black")
##Print
gg


gg<-ggplot(at_sum, aes(x=fct_reorder(BusinessTravel, -attr_avg), y=attr_avg))+ 
  geom_bar(stat="identity")+
  xlab("Amount of Travel") + 
  ylab("Yearly Attrition") +
  geom_bar(stat="Identity", fill="gold", color="black")
##Print
gg

```

*Quick Exercise: Create a bar plot showing average attrition by department instead of travel*
```{r}
at_sum_dept<-at%>%
  group_by(Department)%>%
  summarize(attr_avg=mean(attrit))

gg<-ggplot(at_sum_dept, aes(x=fct_reorder(Department, attr_avg), y=attr_avg)) + 
  geom_bar(stat="identity", fill="dark green", color="black") +
  xlab("Department") +
  ylab("Yearly Attrition")
gg
```

## Dot Plots

A dot plot can be a good way of displaying conditional means as well. Many times dot plots are more easily understood if they are horizontal, so we'll use `coord_flip` to make it horizontal.

```{r}
## Now a dot plot
gg<-ggplot(at_sum, aes(x=fct_reorder(BusinessTravel, -attr_avg), y=attr_avg))
gg<-gg+geom_point(color="gold", size=15) #here's where you're telling R you want a dot plot
gg<-gg+xlab("Travel")+ylab("Average Attrition")
gg<-gg+coord_flip()
gg
```

## Conditional means using two predictors

We can use graphics to display conditional means at multiple levels of predictor levels. There are a couple of ways to get this done. When using bar plots we've got two basic tools: location and color. In the first example, we're going to plot attrition by travel and gender. We'll use color to indicate gender and location to indicate travel.

```{r}
## Summarize attrition by travel AND gender & save to dataset
at_sum_bizgen<-at%>%
  group_by(BusinessTravel, Gender)%>%
  summarize(attr_avg=mean(attrit))

## Get the results
at_sum_bizgen
```

```{r}
## Plot it using a bar plot
gg<-ggplot(at_sum_bizgen, aes(x=fct_reorder(BusinessTravel, attr_avg), y=attr_avg, 
                              color=Gender))
gg<-gg+geom_bar(stat="identity", aes(fill=Gender), position="dodge")
gg<-gg+ylab("Pr(Attrition)")+xlab("Frequency of Travel")

gg

#fun with colors - you can customize EVERYTHING on your ggplot - you can remove things, add things; make your plot look how you want it to! A simple custom color example (note, here I have TWO groups, so I need TWO colors): I'm using dark blue for female; dark green for male (mostly because I really like these colors)
mycolors<-c("#1c4869", "#48691c")

gg<-gg +
  scale_fill_manual(values=mycolors) + #changes fill of bars color
  scale_color_manual(values=mycolors) #changes border color
gg
```

```{r}
## Plot it using a dot plot
gg<-ggplot(at_sum_bizgen, aes(x=reorder(BusinessTravel, attr_avg), y=attr_avg), 
           color=Gender)
gg<-gg+geom_point(aes(color=Gender), size=5)
gg<-gg+ylab("Pr(Attrition)")+xlab("Frequency of Travel")
gg<-gg+coord_flip()

gg

#adding my custom colors again
gg<-gg +
  scale_fill_manual(values=mycolors) +
  scale_color_manual(values=mycolors)
gg
```

* Quick Exercise: Create either a bar plot or a dot plot showing attrition by department AND field of education *
```{r}
## Summarize attrition by department and field of ed
at_sum2<-at%>%
  group_by(Department, EducationField)%>%
  summarize(attr_avg=mean(attrit))

## bar plot
gg<-ggplot(at_sum2, aes(x=fct_reorder(Department, attr_avg), y=attr_avg, color=EducationField)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity", aes(fill=EducationField), position="dodge") + 
  ylab("Pr(Attrition)") +
  xlab("Department")
gg
```


## More Variables: faceting

We can continue this logic with three variables. Now we're going to summarize by Travel, Gender and Marital status. Here we're going to use an additional tool in our arsenal: Faceting. Faceting means making multiple graphs with the same structure. In the code below, we will arrange positions based on travel, color based on gender, and then split the graphic by marital status. 

```{r}
at_bizgenmar<-at%>%
  group_by(BusinessTravel, Gender, MaritalStatus)%>%
  summarize(attr_avg=mean(attrit))%>%
  arrange(-attr_avg)

at_bizgenmar
```

```{r}
gg<-ggplot(at_bizgenmar, aes(x=reorder(BusinessTravel, attr_avg), y=attr_avg, fill=Gender))
## Bar plot, with unstacked (dodge)
gg<-gg+geom_bar(stat="identity", position="dodge")
## Separate out by Marital Status
gg<-gg+facet_wrap(~MaritalStatus)
## Change orientation to sideways
gg<-gg+coord_flip()
## Print
gg
```


*Quick Exercise: Plot predicted attrition by Education Field, Department and Gender*
```{r}
qe_eddeptgen<-at%>%
  group_by(EducationField, Department, Gender)%>%
  summarize(attr_avg=mean(attrit))%>%
  arrange(-attr_avg)

gg<-ggplot(qe_eddeptgen, aes(x=reorder(EducationField, attr_avg), y=attr_avg, fill=Gender))
## Bar plot, with unstacked (dodge)
gg<-gg+geom_bar(stat="identity", position="dodge")
## Separate out by Department
gg<-gg+facet_wrap(~Department)
## Change orientation to sideways, add labels, & angle labels
gg<-gg+
  coord_flip()+
  ylab("Pr(Attrition)") +
  xlab("Department") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust = 1))

## Print
gg
```


## Multiple Predictors for Conditional Means

One solution is to use facets, or lots of little graphs, which show how the pattern varies across different groups. In this case, our groups will be defined by gender and work/life balance. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='hide', warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
## Using Facets
at_sum_bizgenmarwlb<-at%>%
  group_by(BusinessTravel, Gender, MaritalStatus, WorkLifeBalance)%>%
  summarize(attr_avg=mean(attrit))%>%
  ungroup()%>%
  arrange(attr_avg)

at_sum_bizgenmarwlb

gg<-ggplot(at_sum_bizgenmarwlb, aes(x=fct_reorder(BusinessTravel, attr_avg), y=attr_avg))
gg<-gg+geom_bar(stat="identity", aes(fill=MaritalStatus), position="dodge")
gg<-gg+facet_wrap(~Gender+WorkLifeBalance, ncol=4)

gg<-gg+ylab("Proportion of Employees Who Departed")+xlab("Category")
gg<-gg+theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust = 1))
gg<-gg+ggtitle("Departure by Gender and Level of Work/Life Satisfaction")
gg
```
